# CastleGame
My first python text RPG 

Please be aware the code is not very nicely written in some areas but it works and is my first prototype of a python text game.

Hope you enjoy!

Tip: There is lots of clues in keywords within the game, nearly everything can be interactable and can lead to extra clues... read the room descriptions carefully ;) Goodluck!
